/**
 * A {@link RemoteProperty} represents a property that exists on some machine or

 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> The data that this property holds will need to be serialized and
 * sent over the wire. Refer to the {@link PropertyService} that is being used
 * to determine what needs to be done to ensure the data can be marshalled
 * without error.
 * 
 * <p>
 * TODO: a method to mutate the remote property must be added. I have not yet
 * decided on the signature of that method yet. It will come soon. There may
 * also be a need to add methods to lock and unlock a property.
