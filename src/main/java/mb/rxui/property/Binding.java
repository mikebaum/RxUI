/**
 * A Binding is a special type of Property Observer that represents an observer
 * that binds one property to another. When dispatching events property bindings
 * are processed first, this guarantees that all properties have the up to date
 * value instantly at the same time before any other observers receive updates.
 * The reasoning behind this is that it should help to remove glitches and
 * redundant updates. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25141234">glich
